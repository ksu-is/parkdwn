# Parkdown

## Introduction
This is a simple GUI markdown editor written in Python.  It's being created for an Application Development course at Kennesaw State University.


### Features
Parkdwn will allow a user to create a user to create and edit markdown files that will live in a native folder hierarchy, accessible by any other markdown application the user may wish to use.  Eventually, the program will allow exporting to html for posting to the web or to PDF for sharing.

### Future Plans
I'd like to continue developing this application and eventually turn it into a webapp and iOS app.  I'd also like to eventually give the option to encrypt the folder containing all of the notes.

### Updates
11/24/21: I have been working on this on my iPad, but for some reason, I can't get Working Copy to submit anything to GitHub at the moment.  I'm trying to figure that out.  But in the mean time, I transferred the file to my Mac mini to test, but I'm kind of stuck there as well.  My Mac mini is running macOS Monterey (macOS 12), and apparently, Apple changed something that causes an error between Tkinter and the file save dialog.  As it stands, I can't create or save files in this program on my Mac, and my iPad doesn't really give the program the freedom to do that kind of stuff.  I'm trying to figure out what I can do, but I may need to buy an actual laptop to get this figured out.  I'm very, very annoyed.
