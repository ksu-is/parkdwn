# Parkdown

## Introduction
This is a simple GUI markdown editor written in Python.  It's being created for an Application Development course at Kennesaw State University.


### Features
Parkdwn will allow a user to create a user to create and edit markdown files that will live in a native folder hierarchy, accessible by any other markdown application the user may wish to use.  Eventually, the program will allow exporting to html for posting to the web or to PDF for sharing.

### Future Plans
I'd like to continue developing this application and eventually turn it into a webapp and iOS app.  I'd also like to eventually give the option to encrypt the folder containing all of the notes.
